Our first project idea is a web application that prompts users to enter a short phrase about their day (ex: weather/emotion/activity). Then the DALLE AI will generate art based on this phrase. Users will have the ability to store their AI art in an album and view the entire year as a gradient of what they have been entering. This will be handled with an external database to store users' albums of art. For example if a user has been adding weather phrases, the gradient of all their photos lined up may resemble seasonal colors. If a user has been entering emotions they may see happier and sadder months/days. Additionally users will be able to share to social media, the application will be integrated with either Instagram API or Twitter API to ease sharing oneâ€™s art. These APIs will require third-party authentication to construct draft posts.


Our second project idea is to create a web application that allows users to share their Spotify listening statistics with their friends. User statistics will be pulled from the Spotify API and stored in an external database. This data will be used to produce music listening leaderboards among friends. Additionally users will be able to coordinate and plan concerts with their friends. Friendships, groups, concert plans, and saved concerts will all be stored in the external database. Users will be able to be part of multiple groups. Concert data will be pulled from the Songkick API. Users will have the option to log into the website through their Google account, allowing for third-party authentication.
