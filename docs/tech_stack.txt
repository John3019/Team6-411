For our project, we chose Flask for our backend and opted for plain HTML/CSS for our frontend, which allowed for smoother handling of the user state in the backend.

In deciding between Flask and Express, we chose Flask because of its superior support for API calls to OpenAI.

When it came to selecting our database, we considered both SQLite and SQL. Ultimately, we went with SQL because of our team's familiarity with it, which allowed us to work more efficiently.
