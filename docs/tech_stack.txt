We chose flask for our backend and react for our frontend.

We chose between flask and express. We chose flask because flask allowed for more seamless api calls for open.ai. Documentation for openai for express was minimal.

We chose between react and angular. We chose react because of its rendering optimizations and reusable components.

We chose sqlite for our database. We chose between sqlite and mongo. We chose sqlite because of its higher reliability, especially since we have a lower volume of data.
