This application is a fun way to view some of your current listening stats on spotify as well as stats of other users who joined the website. 
You are able to view other peoples listening data from the last time they logged in; everytime a log in occurs we store/update their stats in our database.
Also, the application utilizes GPT-3's Davinci model to reccomend users a song based on recent listening. 

To start the application cd into frontend and type the command "yarn start-backend" into terminal.
